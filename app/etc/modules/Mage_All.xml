[1]  Why are there no modules in this file anymore?
==================================================================================================================
    There were lots of core modules in Mage_All.xml (but not all, as 'Mage_All' would suggest) in unsorted order
    with unsorted dependencies on other modules. In order to create definiteness and clarity here, the modules
    contained in this file have been split into separate module XML files and with dependencies sorted.
    The loading order is unchanged because it was recorded here and can now be traced there:
    \Mage_Core_Model_Config::MAGE_MODULES

    If you are interested, you can read more here:

==================================================================================================================
[2]  Is this file still needed at all?
==================================================================================================================
    No, this file can be safely removed. You can just delete it.

==================================================================================================================
[3]  Why does this file still exist if it can be safely removed?
==================================================================================================================
    There are several ways to update OpenMage. One of them is to download the latest release and just unzip it
    in the project root. If this method was chosen and additional changes were made to Mage_All.xml, problems
    could arise if Mage_All.xml had been deleted from OpenMage immediately. So the decision was made to keep
    this file in the repo for a while without any modules inside.

==================================================================================================================
[4]  What are the future plans for this file?
==================================================================================================================
    There are already ideas to advance the decoupling of the core modules in further PRs and discussions:
      * Mandatory modules that OpenMage depends on to run could be grouped in a file called Mage_Require.xml.
      * Maybe there is a better way to control the loading order of the modules than the current one,
        which should be investigated further.
      * Mage_All.xml should be deleted from the repository.

    This file is located here without any modules inside since OpenMage v19.4.18/v20.0.16.

==================================================================================================================
[5]  Do you need my help? Can I contribute my ideas and/or code?
==================================================================================================================
    Yes, of course. Any contribution is welcome. :)
