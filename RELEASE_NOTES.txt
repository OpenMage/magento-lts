  * We highly recommend disabling Magento cache before upgrading
  * In layout of any custom theme the usage of catalog/product_list_toolbar block should be changed to page/html_pager:
    1) Replace the catalog/product/list/toolbar.phtml of your theme by the new one
    2) Update catalog.xml layout: <block type="catalog/product_list_toolbar" name="product_list_toolbar" template="catalog/product/list/toolbar.phtml"> should be replaced into <block type="page/html_pager" name="product_list_toolbar_pager"/>
