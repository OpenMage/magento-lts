<p>Your Magento folder does not have sufficient write permissions, which this web based downloader requires.</p>
<p>If you wish to proceed downloading Magento packages online, please set all Magento folders to have writable permission for the web server user (example: apache) and press the "Refresh" button to try again.</p>

<button class="form-button" type="button" onclick="location.reload()"><span>Refresh</span></button>
<br/><br/><br/>
