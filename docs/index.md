# Magento - Long Term Support

This repository is the home of an **unofficial** community-driven project. It's goal is to be a dependable alternative
to the Magento CE official releases which integrates improvements directly from the community while maintaining a high
level of backwards compatibility to the official releases.

__Pull requests with bug fixes and security patches from the community are encouraged and welcome!__

## Magento 1 Compatibility

OpenMage LTS 19.4.0 is the first tagged version using the OpenMage LTS version naming system and all 19.x versions are mostly backward-compatible
with Magento 1.9.4.x.

OpenMage LTS 20.x and later have more changes that may not be 100% backward-compatible, but minimizing migration and upgrade hassle for users is always
considered an important goal and factors heavily into the changes that are accepted even when accepting changes for `MAJOR` releases, described in [Releases and Versioning](users/versioning/index.md).
