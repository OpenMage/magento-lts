## Since OpenMage 19.5.0 / 20.1.0

PHP 7.4 is now the minimum required version.

Most of the 3rd party libraries/modules that were bundled in our repository were removed and migrated to composer dependencies.
This allows for better maintenance and upgradability.

Specifically:

- `phpseclib`
- `mcrypt_compat`
- `Cm_RedisSession`
- `Cm_Cache_Backend_Redis`
- `Pelago_Emogrifier` ([#2411](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/2411))
- Zend Framework 1 ([#2827](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/2827))

If your project uses OpenMage through composer then all dependencies will be managed automatically.  
If you just extracted the release zip/tarball in your project's main folder then be sure to:
- remove the old copy of aforementioned libraries from your project, you can do that with this command:
  ```bash
  rm -rf app/code/core/Zend lib/Cm lib/Credis lib/mcryptcompat lib/Pelago lib/phpseclib lib/Zend
  ```

- download the new release zip file that is named `openmage-VERSIONNUMBER.zip`, this one is built to contain the `vendor`
  folder generated by composer, with all the dependencies in it
- extract the zip file in your project's repository as you always did

We also decided to remove our Zend_DB patches (that were stored in `app/code/core/Zend`) because they were very old and
not compatible with the new implementations made by ZF1-Future, which is much more advanced and feature rich.
This may generate a problem with `Zend_Db_Select` statements that do not use `Zend_Db_Expr` to quote expressions.
If you see SQL errors after upgrading please remember to check for this specific issue in your code.

UPS shut down their old CGI APIs, so we removed the support for it from the `Mage_Usa` module.

## Between OpenMage 20.x and 21.x (unreleased, available on branch `next`)

- PHP 8.1 as minimum required version
- Removed `scriptaculous/dragdrop.js` ([#3215](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/3215))
- RWD theme: updated jQuery to 3.7.0 ([#3204](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/3204))
- Unified CSRF configuration ([#3147](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/3147)) and added form key validation to Contacts form ([#3146](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/3146))
- Removed double span element from HTML buttons ([#3123](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/3123))
- Removed all deprecated `Mysql4_` classes ([#2730](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/2730)). If there are any old modules/extensions in your installation that use such classes, you must run `shell/rename-mysql4-class-to-resource.php` in the command line in order to convert them. Backup all files before running the script
- Removed "admin routing compatibility mode" ([#1551](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/1551))
