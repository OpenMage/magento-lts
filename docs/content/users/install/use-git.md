# Git (for contributors)

If you want to hack at the core and contribute to the project with a Pull Request, we're very grateful and hope you find it easy to contribute!

1. [Fork](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/fork) the project so you can push your commits later.
2. Clone your fork to your development host with `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GIT USERNAME>/magento-lts`
3. Use either the [DDEV](/developers/tools/ddev/) or the [Docker Compose](/developers/tools/oneline/) development environment to hack away.
4. Commit and push your code up to your own fork from step 1.
5. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/compare)!
