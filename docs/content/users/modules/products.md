## `CustomGento_ProductBadges`
Product Badges for Magento 1 offers you the possibility to add highly customizable badges to your product images without having any performance impact. You can freely define where a badge should be shown via price-rule-like conditions. Using a custom indexer, the rendering of the badges is insanely fast.
