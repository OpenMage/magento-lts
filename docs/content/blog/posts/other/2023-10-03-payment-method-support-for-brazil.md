# Payment Method Support for Brazil

Brazil has one of the biggest populations in the world and is a key market for e-commerce. However, the country has unique payment preferences and challenges that merchants need to consider when selling to Brazilian customers.

We are excited to announce the availability of the [PagBank Integrações](https://pbintegracoes.com) module for OpenMage, an open-source solution that allows merchants to accept a wide range of payment methods in Brazil. This module is continuously updated to support both Magento 1 and OpenMage platforms since 2014.

## Peculiarities of Payments in Brazil

Brazil has a unique payment landscape with several popular methods:

- **PIX**: An instant payment system created by the Central Bank of Brazil, allowing for instantaneous and real-time payments 24/7 using QrCodes.
- **Boleto Bancário**: A popular payment method where customers generate a boleto (bank slip) and pay it at banks, ATMs, online banking or even at supermarkets.
- **Installments**: Many Brazilian consumers prefer to pay in installments, spreading the cost of a purchase over several months. This is a common practice and is supported by most credit card issuers in Brazil.

## Features of PagBank Integrações

- **3D Secure Authentication**: Enhances the security of online transactions by requiring an additional layer of verification, reducing the risk of fraud and significantly improving the approval rate.
- **Support for Major Payment Types**: Including credit cards, PIX, and Boleto Bancário.
- **Installment Payments**: Allows customers to pay in multiple installments, making it easier to afford higher-priced items.
- **Lowest Fees**: When you use this official partner module, you get one of the lowest fees in the market and pay less than official rates, while support the project.

With PagBank Integrações, you can provide your customers with a seamless and secure payment experience, tailored to the unique needs of the Brazilian market. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements to this essential module for OpenMage.
