# New Release 20.2.0

OpenMage continues its remarkable journey with an important new release!

Among the numerous pull requests, one truly stands out. After months of development,
we are thrilled to announce a significant upgrade to a core component of the OpenMage backend:

The TinyMCE rich text editor skyrockets from  its "more than 10-years-old" version 3 to the new and shining version 6.7!
