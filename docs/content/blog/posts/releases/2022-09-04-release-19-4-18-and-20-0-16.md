# New Release 19.4.18 and 20.0.16

This is a bugfix release [^1] [^2] with a couple of perfect enhancements.
In the meanwhile we're working on completing the full PHPStan validation, which is allowing us to reformat the whole source code to make it look more beautiful than ever.

<!-- more -->

Last but not least, we already merged 2 PRs for the upcoming PHP 8.2 support!
