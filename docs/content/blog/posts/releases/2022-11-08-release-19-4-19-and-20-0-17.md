# New Release 19.4.19 and 20.0.17

## Important things you should check before upgrading

This release [^1] [^2] requires PHP 7.3 with `intl` extension, do not upgrade if your system doesn't match this requirement.

<!-- more -->

This is a maintenance release with small bugfixes, code cleanup, documentation improvements and a better overall PHPStan coverage.
We're also bumping the minimum required PHP version to 7.3 with `intl` extension enabled.
Our source code finally has a much better "copyright" section, to thank all the team that is contributing to this beautiful project.
