# New Release 19.4.21

This is a hot-fix release [^1], it includes only the solution to a single bug that was released in 19.4.20 ([#2793](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/2793)).

<!-- more -->

Said bug doesn't seem to be present on 20.0.18 and that's why you'll not find the matching hot-fix release for our v20 branch.

Upgrading is highly suggested, but always backup and test before doing it.
