# New Release 19.4.21

This is a hotfix release [^1], it includes only the solution to a single bug that was released in 19.4.20 (OpenMage/magento-lts#2793).

<!-- more -->

Said bug doesn't seem to be present on 20.0.18 and that's why you'll not find the matching hotfix release for our v20 branch.

Upgrading is highly suggested, but always backup and test before doing it.
