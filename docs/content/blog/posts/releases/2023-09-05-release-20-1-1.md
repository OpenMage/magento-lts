# New Release 20.1.1

After the colossal 20.1.0 [^2] release just a few weeks back, it's time for a little "smooth the edges" update, but don't be fooled, it's as important as your morning coffee!

<!-- more -->

## Highlights [^1]

- 🛠️ ZF1Future's version in composer is strictly specified now, it order to fix problems with future upstream upgrades and our composer patches
- 🚀 Totally new JSON-RPC API is now available, with support for install-login via HTTP basic auth, it seems to be much more performant than the SOAP one so definitely check it out
- 📦 USPS module got a nice upgrade to support the latest changes in USPS APIs and services
- 🍪 A vulnerability about "guest order view" cookie tampering was fixed, with the introduction of a "rate limiting" API you can use in your own code too
- 🐞 Few other bugfix and updates
