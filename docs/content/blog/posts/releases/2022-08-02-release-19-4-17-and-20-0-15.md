# New Release 19.4.17 and 20.0.15

## Important things you should check before upgrading

With the release of OpenMage 19.4.17 [^1] and 20.0.15 [^2], `targetNamespace` changed for of all the WSDL files (used in the API modules), from `Magento` to `OpenMage`.

<!-- more -->

If your custom modules extends OpenMage's APIs with a custom WSDL file and there are some hardcoded targetNamespace="urn:Magento" string, your APIs may stop working.

Please replace all occurrences of `targetNamespace="urn:Magento"` with `targetNamespace="urn:OpenMage"` (or alternatively `targetNamespace="urn:{{var wsdl.name}}"`) to avoid any problem.

To find which files need the modification you can run from the root directory of your project:

``` bash
grep -rn 'urn:Magento' --include \*.xml
```
