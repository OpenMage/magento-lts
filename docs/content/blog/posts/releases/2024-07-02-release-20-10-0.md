# New Release 20.10.0

This release brings `copyable` cells to back-end grids, preliminary PHP 8.4 support, improved MariaDB compatibility and fixes to a bundle of important issues.

From smoothing out UPS REST API handling, an old cache problem in primary navigation block and a couple of minor regressions in product's attribute handling. [^1]
