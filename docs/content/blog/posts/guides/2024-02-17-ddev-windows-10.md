# Test Environment for OpenMage in Windows 10 Based on DDEV

This guide will be updated frequently.

### IMPORTANT
If you run Windows OS in a virtual machine, it is mandatory to activate the virtualization option. For example, in VMware with the virtual machine off, access `Edit virtual machine settings`. In the `Hardware` tab select `Processors` and in the `Virtualization engine` section check the `Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI` option.

You need at least 8 GB of memory to run (Docker + PHPStorm) decent. I recommend a machine with 16 GB.

### (Windows) Installing the Windows Terminal Application
1. Open the `Microsoft Store` application and search for `Windows Terminal`
2. Choose the first result then press the `Get` button

If you use PHPStorm, at the bottom there is a tab called `Terminal`. Here you can run commands in the Linux distribution too.

### (Windows) Installing WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)
**The Installation Tutorial**
https://pureinfotech.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-2-windows-10/

**Useful Commands**
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/
```
wsl --install
wsl --version
wsl --update
wsl --list --online
wsl --install -d DISTRO-NAME
wsl --set-version <distro name> 2
```

**Advanced Settings**
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#configure-global-options-with-wslconfig

You can configure limits on the memory, CPU and swap size allocated to WSL 2 in a `.wslconfig` file‚Å†. For example, create a file named `.wslconfig` in the `C:\Users\<User Name>` directory with the following content

```
[wsl2]
memory=4GB   # Limits VM memory in WSL 2 up to 4 GB
processors=6 
```

### (Windows) Installing a Linux Distribution
**Variant 1**
1.  Open the `Command Prompt` application as Administrator
2. Get the distributions list `wsl --list --online`
3. Install a distribution `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
4. Reboot the system

**Variant 2**
1.  Open the `Microsoft Store` application and search for Ubuntu
2. Install an LTS version, for example Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
3. Reboot the system

Open the `Terminal` application then choose a new tab with Ubuntu. Follow the steps to complete the installation, setting the `username` and `password` (e.g. ubuntu / 1234).

### (Windows) Installing Docker
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

1. Download the installation file `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` and run it as Administrator
2. During installation check the option `Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V (recommended)`
3. Reboot the system

### (Windows) Installing mkcert for Secured Connections
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert

1. Download the latest Windows release
2. Open the `Terminal` application as Administrator
3. Go to the directory where you downloaded the executable file named `mkcert-vX.X.X-windows-amd64.exe`
4. Run `mkcert-vX.X.X-windows-amd64.exe --install`
5. In the popup window, where you are asked if you want to install the certificate, press `Yes`

### (Windows) Linux distribution drive mapping

1. Open the `Windows Explorer` application
2. On the left side open the `Linux` path and select `Ubuntu-20.04`
3. Right-click and select `Map network drive...` from the menu. Choose a letter, for example Z:

From now on it appears in the `This PC` section under `Network locations`. If you want to disconnect it, right-click and select `Disconnect` from the menu.

### (Windows) PHPStorm

Create a new project in PHPStorm that has the location where you cloned the OpenMage repository. If you log in to your GitHub account, you will see in the `Pull Request` tab on the left the open PRs from OpenMage. Open one and checkout to start testing. When you are done, at the bottom of the PHPStorm window you will see the `Git` tab. Click on it, then right click on `Local > main` and select `Checkout`. You can update the repositories, locals and remotes, from time to time and more.

### (Linux) Installing DDEV
https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/ddev-installation/

1. Open the `Terminal` application and choose a new tab with Ubuntu
2. Bring all the packages up to date Ubuntu `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
3. Install DDEV according to the instructions

### (Linux) Copying mkcert Certificates from Windows to Linux

**Variant 1**
1. Open the `Terminal` application and choose a new tab with Ubuntu
2. Create the path  `mkdir -p /home/<user_name/.local/share/mkcert`
3. Run `cp /mnt/c/Users/<User Name>/AppData/Local/mkcert/* /home/<user_name>/.local//share/mkcert/`

**Variant 2**
1. Run the `Windows Explorer` application as administrator
2. Copy the files `rootCA.pem` and `rootCA-key.pem` from `C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Local\mkcert`
3. Create the path in Linux > Ubuntu-20.04 `/home/<user_name/.local/share/mkcert`
4. Paste them in the `mkcert` directory

### (Linux) Installing OpenMage
First make sure that the `Docker Desktop` application is running in Windows.

1. Open the `Terminal` application and choose a new tab with Ubuntu
2. Create the path `mkdir -p /home/<user_name>/openmage`
3. Clone the OpenMage repository `git clone https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts.git /home/<user_name>/openmage`
4. Go to the directory `/home/<user_name>/openmage`
5. Run the following DDEV commands. The first command configures the project, the second installs OpenMage dependencies, the third installs Magento Sample Data.

```
ddev config
ddev composer install
ddev openmage-install -s -k
```

6. Edit the `.ddev/config.yaml` file to change the webserver and PHP version as you want. I am using Apache and PHP 8.3

```
php_version: "8.3"
webserver_type: apache-fpm
```

7. Run the following DDEV commands to load the project in the browser window with a secured connection

```
ddev start
ddev launch
```

For more information about using DDEV please visit https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/blob/main/docs/DDEV.md. It is a fantastic tool!

### CONCLUSION
As you can see, the more complicated part is the initial configuration of WSL, Docker, DDEV. Once done, it doesn't take more than 3-5 minutes to get an instance of OpenMage ready for testing. Forget about XAMPP, WAMP in Windows.

You can use a test environment in Windows without WSL2, but I do not recommend this configuration because DDEV must be installed in Windows and not inside the Linux distribution. It depends on Mutagen and it is very very slow. Testing in a Linux distribution has many advantages and it is close to moving the project into production.
