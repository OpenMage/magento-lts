# Testing

Three steps are required for utilizing REST API resources:

*   [Authenticate the user](http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/rest/authentication/oauth_authentication.html "OAuth Authentication") (receive the access token for further steps);
*   Configure the [permissions for operations](http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/rest/permission_settings/roles_configuration.html "REST Roles Configuration") and [attributes](http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/rest/permission_settings/attributes_configuration.html "REST Attributes Configuration") for the type of the user;
*   Make an API call.

The following headers are required for the call:

*   Authorization
*   Version
*   Accept
*   Content-type

The following parameters must be provided in the Authorization header for the call:

*   oauth\_signature\_method
*   oauth\_version
*   oauth\_nonce
*   oauth\_timestamp
*   oauth\_consumer\_key
*   oauth\_token
*   oauth\_signature

#### Testing REST resources with the [REST Client](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/) plugin for the Mozilla Firefox browser.

1.  Open the REST Client.
2.  From the Authentication drop-down, select **OAuth**.

3.  In the OAuth window, on the Signature for the request tab, fill in the following fields:
    *   **Consumer key**: Enter the **Key** value provided when you created the consumer in Magento Admin Panel.
    *   **Consumer secret**: Enter the **Secret** value provided when you created the consumer in Magento Admin Panel.
    *   **Access token**: Enter the oauth\_token value received when you authenticated the application.
    *   **Access token secret**: Enter the oauth\_token\_secret value received when you authenticated the application.
4.  On the OAuth setting tab, define the following options: ![](assets/images/rest_test_oauth_tab.png)
    *   **Signature Methods**: From the drop-down list, select which method will be used for signatures (HMAC-SHA1 or PLAINTEXT).
    *   **oAuth Version**: From the drop-down list, select the **1.0** option (REST API supports OAuth 1.0a).
    *   Leave the **Realm**, **oAuth Nonce**, and **oAuth Timestamp** values set by default.
5.  Click **Save** and wait for the confirmation dialog to close.

6.  Return to the Signature for the request tab and select **Insert > Insert as header**. ![](assets/images/rest_test_insert.png)

    An authorization header is created on the main page of REST Client.

    ![](assets/images/rest_test004.png)
12.  In the **Request Header** window, enter "Content-Type" in the **Name** field and "text/xml" in the **Value** field (if you want to use the XML data format). To use the JSON request data format, enter application/json instead of the text/xml value.
13.  Click **Okay**.

6.  In the **Type** group of options, select the **Signed Request** option.
7.  In the **signature method** group of options, select which method will be used for signatures (HMAC-SHA1 or PLAINTEXT).
8.  Fill in the following data:  
    ![](assets/images/rest_test010.png)
    *   **Consumer key**: Enter the **Key** value provided when you created the consumer in Magento Admin Panel.
    *   **Consumer secret**: Enter the **Secret** value provided when you created the consumer in Magento Admin Panel.
    *   **Access Token**: Enter the oauth\_token value received when you authenticated the application.
    *   **Access Token Secret**: Enter the oauth\_token\_secret value received when you authenticated the application.
9.  Click **OK**.  
    **NOTE**: Advanced REST Client does not save the **Consumer secret** and **Access Token Secret** values. You need to enter these values each time you make a request.
10.  In the **URL** field, enter the URL to which the API call will be performed and select the required HTTP method.
11.  In the **Headers** table, click **Add row** and add the Accept - application/json or Accept - text/xml header depending on which format you prefer for the returned data.
12.  Click **Send Request**.

**Example: Retrieving the list of customers**
