# OpenMage Environment Based on DDEV (https://ddev.com/)

## Using n98-magerun

You can use the swiss army knife for Magento developers, sysadmins and devops. The tool provides a huge set of well tested command line commands which save hours of work time. 

Run any n98-magerun command in the terminal window by adding **ddev** in front of it. For example `ddev magerun sys:info` prints infos about the current OpenMage system. 

For more information about the available commands please visit https://n98-magerun.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

## Using phpMyAdmin

Run in the terminal window `ddev get ddev/ddev-phpmyadmin` to install the phpMyAdmin add-on then restart DDEV. 

To launch phpMyAdmin in the browser run in the terminal window `ddev phpmyadmin`.

## Using Mailpit

To launch Mailpit in the browser run in the terminal window `ddev mailpit`.

## Setting up cronjobs

Run in the terminal window `ddev get ddev/ddev-cron` to install the cron add-on then restart DDEV. 

By default the OpenMage cronjob runs every minute. If you want to change it edit the file `.ddev/web-build/openmage.cron`.

You can set the OpenMage cronjob using DDEV hooks, but you must comment all the lines in the file `.ddev/web-build/openmage.cron`. Edit the file `.ddev/config.yaml` and insert the following lines

```
hooks:
  post-start:
    - exec: printf "SHELL=/bin/bash\n* * * * * /var/www/html/cron.sh\n" | crontab

```

## Enabling the Developer Mode

Set environment variables editing the file `.ddev/config.yaml`. If you want to enable the Developer Mode insert the following lines

```
web_environment: [
    MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE=1
]
```

## Using Xdebug with PhpStorm

Every DDEV project is automatically configured with Xdebug so that popular IDEs can do step debugging of PHP code. Xdebug is a server-side tool and it is installed automatically in the container so you do not have to install or configure it on your workstation. Xdebug is disabled by default for performance reasons, so you will need to enable it and configure your IDE before can start debugging. For more information, please visit https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/debugging-profiling/step-debugging/.

Run the following commands in the terminal window to enable or disable xDebug 

`ddev xdebug on`

`ddev xdebug off`

If Xdebug does not work properly with PHPStorm edit the file `.ddev/php/xdebug.ini` and insert the following lines

```
[xdebug]
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=trigger
```

## Accessing the database in PhpStorm

Please note that DDEV changes the port numbers on every restart. If you want to access the database in PHPStorm you must set up a fixed port. Edit the file `.ddev/config.yaml` and insert the following line

```
host_db_port: 6000
```

## Using Browsersync (https://github.com/ddev/ddev-browsersync)

Browsersync features live reloads, click mirroring, network throttling. Run the following commands in the terminal window

```
ddev get ddev/ddev-browsersync
ddev restart
ddev browsersync
```

## Installing Compass (http://compass-style.org/)

Compass is required for editing SCSS files.

Create a new file named `.ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.ddev-compass` and insert the following lines

```
ARG BASE_IMAGE
FROM $BASE_IMAGE
RUN apt-get update
RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests build-essential ruby-full rubygems
RUN gem install compass
```

## Creating a DDEV command

Create a new file named `phpstan` in the `.ddev/commands/web` directory and insert the following lines

```
#!/bin/bash

## Description: run PHPStan
## Usage: phpstan
## Example: ddev phpstan <path-to-files>

php vendor/bin/phpstan analyze -c .github/phpstan.neon "$@"
```

Run in the terminal window `ddev phpstan`.

## OpenMage DDEV commands

**1. If you want to install the `Magento Sample Data` run in the terminal window `ddev openmage-install` and follow the steps.**

You can use flags, for example `ddev openmage-install -d -s -k -q`

```
-d (default values for the administrator account)
-s (sampledata installation)
-k (keeps the downloaded archive in the .ddev/.sampleData directory)
-q (quiet mode)
```

**2. By default, running the `ddev config` command does not create an administrator account. If you want to create or update one run in the terminal window `ddev openmage-admin` and follow the steps.**

## Using mkcert for secured connections (https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. If you use (Windows 10/11 + WSL + Docker), first install the mkcert package in Windows then copy the certificates files associated to the current user into the Linux distribution. 

For example, copy `rootCA.pem` and `rootCA-key.pem`

```
From: C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Local\mkcert
To: /home/<user_name>/.local/share/mkcert
```

## Installing OpenMage in the browser

If you want to install OpenMage in the browser rename or delete the `/app/etc/local.xml` file.

For the database connection use the following information

```
Host: db
Database Name: db
User Name: db
User Password: db
```
