# Magento - Long Term Support

This repository is the home of an **unofficial** community-driven project. It's goal is to be a dependable alternative
to the Magento CE official releases which integrates improvements directly from the community while maintaining a high
level of backwards compatibility to the official releases.

**Pull requests with unofficial bug fixes and security patches from the community are encouraged and welcome!**

Though Magento does not follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) we aim to provide a workable system for
dependency definition. Each Magento `1.<minor>.<revision>` release will get its own branch (named `1.<minor>.<revision>.x`)
that will be independently maintained with upstream patches and community bug fixes for as long as it makes sense
to do so (based on available resources). For example, Magento version `1.9.3.4` was merged into the `1.9.3.x` branch.

Note, the branches older than `1.9.3.x` that were created before this strategy came into practice are **not maintained**.
