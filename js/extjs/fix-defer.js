 * Both ExtJS and PrototypeJS write to Function.prototype.defer
 * However, PrototypeJS has a default delay of 0.01s if no first argument is provided
 * Ref: https://github.com/prototypejs/prototype/blob/1.7.3/src/prototype/lang/function.js#L292-L295
 * While ExtJS executes the function immediately. Presumably this causes an error for
